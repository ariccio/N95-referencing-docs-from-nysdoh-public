# N95-referencing-docs-from-nysdoh-public
 Documents found by searching google with `"n95" site:https://www.health.ny.gov/`

This is a collection of documents I found with that google search, along with some of my own notes, and the links thereto. I've downloaded them and put them in this repo to prevent link rot, and to deal with intentional removal.

My notes are in `DOH N95 notes.txt`, and all pdf files (except for a corrupted minutes file) are stored in the same filename as they were served by on the web. Web pages are saved as a "Print to PDF" file under the same name as the web page title (as autosuggested by chrome).
