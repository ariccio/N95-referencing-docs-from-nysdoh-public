"Influenza Information for Health Care Providers > N95 Interim Guidance: NYSDOH Position Statement"
    "DOH has a number of concerns about CDC's interim guidance on N95 respirator use by healthcare workers during a pandemic, including the lack of a solid evidence base for the recommendations, the possible adverse impact that focusing on respiratory protection will detract from other, more important infection control measures, and the difficulties with stockpiling sufficient N95 respirators and fit testing all staff who would use them."

    " All HCP and other facility staff shall wear a facemask while within 6 feet of residents. Extended wear of facemasks is allowed; facemasks should be changed when soiled or wet and when HCP go on breaks. Facilities should bundle care and minimize the number of HCP and other staff who enter rooms to reduce the number of personnel requiring facemasks."
    "Residents must wear facemasks when HCP or other direct care providers enter their rooms, unless such is not tolerable. "
    "In NHs, all residents on affected units should be placed on droplet and contact precautions, regardless of the presence of symptoms and regardless of COVID-19 status. HCP and other direct care providers should wear gown, gloves, eye protection (goggles or a face shield), and N95 respirators (or equivalent) if the facility has a respiratory program with fit tested staff and N95s. Otherwise, HCP and other direct care providers should wear gown, gloves, eye protection, and facemasks. Facilities may implement extended use of eye protection and facemasks/N95s when moving from resident to resident (i.e. do not change between residents) unless other medical conditions which necessitate droplet precautions are present. However, gloves and gowns must be changed and hand hygiene must be performed."

    "Another alternative to requiring covered entities to mandate vaccination would be to require covered entities to mandate all personnel to wear a fit-tested N95 face covering at all times when in the facility, in order to prevent transmission of the virus. However, acceptable face coverings, which are not fit-tested N95 face coverings have been a long-standing requirement in these covered entities, and, while helpful to reduce transmission it does not prevent transmission and; therefore, masking in addition to vaccination will help reduce the numbers of infections in these settings even further."

March 22, 2020
https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/03/doh_covid19_dentalsettingsguidance_032220.pdf
    "Currently, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to primarily spread person-to-person via respiratory droplets through close contact. Dental providers maintain close contact with patients during a dental procedure, placing them at risk of transmission via droplets from dental procedures. "
    "The CDC recommends that dental healthcare personnel assessing a patient with influenza-like or other respiratory illness should wear disposable surgical facemask, nonsterile gloves, gown, and eye protection (e.g., goggles or face shield) to prevent exposure. Aerosol-generating procedures should be avoided whenever possible, and steps should be taken to avoid or lessen aerosol generation with all procedures. A properly fit-tested N95 respirator or equivalent should be used for aerosol-generating procedures. If not available, then dental providers should use their clinical judgement to determine the best course of action, which might include offering an alternative procedure or providing care in a setting where N95s are available."
    "Patients, staff, and dental healthcare workers should perform hand hygiene (e.g., hand washing with non-antimicrobial soap and water, alcohol-based hand rub, or antiseptic handwash) after possible contact with respiratory secretions and contaminated objects/materials"

    "DR. VAN DER JAGT: I just have a question again relating to prevention and the E.M.S. provider. What are the recommendations for use of masks, and what is -- you know, what is the, you know, these E.M.S. providers are probably exposed a lot to this particular virus, or any flu virus, so are there recommendations that you have for them, and maybe Lee would like to talk about that a little bit, too. I don't know -- I just think it's something that needs to be addressed."
    "MS. BURNS: Actually, the C.D.C. recommends N95s for patient care providers who are treating patients with flu-like symptoms. The Health Department has said that surgical masks are adequate. There s a -- there s a lot of -- of conversation at the local level. Some localities believe that they would just as soon err on the side of being conservative and use N95s. The N95s require fit testing."
    [...lots of blah about fit testing]
    "So, there is -- really the answer to your question is the C.D.C. guideline is N95s, state Health Department has said surgical masks. DR. VAN DER JAGT: And how well are they following those regulations? MS. BURNS: Thats a very good question. I -- I think -- honestly, they dont want to be -- they don t want to be exposed, and they don t want to -- certainly dont want to take it home to their family."

    "In addition, it is possible that the SARS virus might spread more broadly through the air (airborne spread) or by other ways that are not now known."
    "If you have SARS, you should:"
        "Cover your mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing. If you have a surgical mask, wear it during close contact with other people. A mask can reduce the number of droplets coughed into the air."

    "Most exposures to SARS occur in healthcare facilities and households. Community transmission outside of these settings have been reported, but these occurred rarely, under special circumstances, and with few exceptions, after close contact with ill persons. Persons at risk in healthcare facilities include healthcare workers, patients, and visitors. In households, the greatest risk is to family members of SARS patients."
